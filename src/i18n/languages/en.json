Together we will complete a small proof of concept or minimum viable product to solve a specific problem in your department. After working with us, you go back to your SBU and will take care of SBU-specific use cases on your own data team. Of course, as a team we continue to support you in the implementation of the use cases, but with the aim of making the new data team more independent in the long term.",
